I am 17 years old. I have been programming for a year, I have already achieved a lot, among other things, that I earned a little money at a young age. I educate myself during pregnancy and improve my languages: Java, Java Script, Python, Html, Css, PhP, and that's enough for me at the time. I would like to achieve much more in the future. If you need my help, write to me, we will get along for sure!
